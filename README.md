# Feedback from prof
- proper motivation
- plot visualisation should be more readable and sufficient font size

- feature selection should be more than correlation analysis, as it only shows linear correlation
- location/distance information is useful
- OneMap API not necessary, use `sg-hdb-block-details.csv`
- `FLAT_TYPE` encoding: make sure the labels are ranked based on price 
- include year/month as a feature 

- only tune the most promising hyperparameter on a better model
- prioritise traditional models over MLP 

- Apart from just bringing the RSME, you may also want to explore any other insights the data or the model(s) tell you. A good model is not just one that makes good predictions.(?)
